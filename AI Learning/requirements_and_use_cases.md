# Requirements and Use Cases for Custom AI Chatbots

## Website Q&A Chatbot Requirements

A website Q&A chatbot serves as a virtual assistant that can answer visitor questions about a company's products, services, policies, and other information contained within the website. This type of chatbot enhances user experience by providing immediate responses without requiring visitors to navigate through multiple pages.

### Key Requirements:

- **Natural Language Understanding**: The capability to interpret user questions asked in conversational language and match them to relevant information.
- **Contextual Awareness**: Understanding the context of questions within a conversation to provide coherent follow-up responses.
- **Multilingual Support**: Optional ability to respond in multiple languages depending on the company's customer base.
- **Integration with Website**: Seamless embedding into the website interface, typically as a chat widget.
- **Analytics**: Tracking of common questions, user satisfaction, and conversation flows to improve the chatbot over time.

### Business Scenarios:
- An e-commerce company using a chatbot to answer product specification questions and guide purchasing decisions

## Common Requirements Across All Use Cases

Regardless of the specific application, all AI chatbot implementations share certain fundamental requirements:

- **User-friendly Interface**: Simple, intuitive interfaces that make interaction natural and effortless.
- **Accuracy and Reliability**: Providing correct information consistently.
